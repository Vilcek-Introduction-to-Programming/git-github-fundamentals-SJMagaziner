Homework Computational Reproducibility I 

I have worked with Git prior.  In fact I have taken a good number of coding courses in undergraduate, graduate school, and now here as an MD/PhD.
However, github remains a unique beast to master.  The syntax, terms, and issues that can arise when pushing new commits can be burdensome.  To this day it proves a challenge.
This course did an excellent job of introing Git in a friendly matter (both IDE based and broswer based). At the end of the day I suppose it is just about practice.  

Regarding computational reproducibility, Wilson et al. highlight the importance of the tracking of changes across code. In many ways this is analagous to keeping 
updated laboratory notebooks in a wet lab setting. RStudio (and other IDEs) when used jointly with Git can better facilitate this through the combinaton of pushes and commits
on a cloud storage basis.  Inherently this removes multiple iterations of scripts that may lack proper annotation.
